# Implementation Progress

This document tracks the development progress against the `DESIGN.md` schematic.

## Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Core Layout (Complete)

- [x] **Project Initialization**: Set up a new React project using Vite.
- [x] **Dependency Installation**: Installed all required npm packages, including `react`, `zustand`, `react-grid-layout`, `styled-components`, etc.
- [x] **Basic App Layout**: Created the main 3-column structure for the Toolbar, Canvas, and Properties panel in `App.jsx`.
- [x] **Zustand Store**: Initialized a basic Zustand store (`useStore.js`) to manage `layout` and `elements` state.
- [x] **Canvas Component**: Created the `CanvasComponent.jsx`.
- [x] **Grid Integration**: Integrated `react-grid-layout` into the `CanvasComponent`.
- [x] **State Connection**: Connected the `CanvasComponent` to the Zustand store to read the initial layout and elements.
- [x] **Basic Rendering**: The application now successfully renders draggable elements from the store onto the grid.

## Next Steps

The foundational structure is complete. The next phase will focus on adding interactivity and features.

- **Implement the Toolbar**: Add functionality to the Toolbar to allow users to add new elements to the canvas.
- **Implement the Properties Panel**: Build the UI and logic for editing the properties (content, styling) of a selected element.
- **Implement Element Types**: Create different components for each element type (text, image, icon).
- **Firebase Integration**: Set up Firebase for user authentication and data persistence.
- **Image Handling**: Integrate `react-image-crop` for uploading and cropping images.
